## Abstract

Recently, Zhao Haotian, a PhD candidate at the University of Science and Technology of China, and Professor He Lixin proposed and implemented a Hybrid Gauge Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (Hybrid gauge rt-TDDFT) applicable to atomic orbital basis sets in the domestic open-source density functional theory software ABACUS. Based on the traditional velocity gauge, this method introduces a time-varying phase dependent on the vector potential, effectively overcoming the systematic errors caused by the incompleteness of the local basis set and providing consistent and reliable simulation results in both periodic and non-periodic systems. At the same time, this method significantly improves the calculation efficiency in periodic systems, offering a new solution that combines accuracy and efficiency for first-principles real-time dynamics simulations under the action of an electric field.
## Introduction

Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is an important theoretical method for studying the electronic dynamics of materials in excited states and under the drive of external fields. It is widely used in frontier fields such as nonlinear optical responses, ultrafast spectroscopy, and charge and energy transport. Compared with linear response methods, rt-TDDFT can directly track the quantum dynamics trajectory of electrons during time evolution, making it particularly suitable for strong-field excitation and non-linear processes far from equilibrium. Therefore, it has become a key means for studying phenomena such as light-matter interaction and carrier relaxation. However, conducting rt-TDDFT calculations in periodic systems still faces challenges. The direct application of the traditional velocity gauge in numerical atomic orbital (NAO) basis sets ignores the internal phase changes of orbitals caused by the vector potential, resulting in systematic errors that seriously affect the calculation accuracy of key physical quantities such as current responses and nonlinear optics. To solve this problem, Zhao Haotian and He Lixin proposed the hybrid gauge algorithm. By explicitly introducing the local phase correction induced by the vector potential, it effectively overcomes the limitations of the velocity gauge in local basis sets and constructs a rigorous and efficient theoretical framework, providing a new solution for the study of ultrafast electron dynamics in periodic systems.
## Hybrid Gauge Theory

In rt-TDDFT, we can simulate the dynamic response of a system under external excitations such as an electric field by adding a time-dependent external field term to the Hamiltonian. The most commonly used is the length gauge, and its Hamiltonian form is relatively simple, containing only an additional scalar potential term:
